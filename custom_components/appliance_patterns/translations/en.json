Recommendations:\n- set the ON threshold slightly above the standby draw\n- set the OFF threshold near zero but still above noise\n- OFF delay must be long enough to ignore short pauses\n- the detection window should be longer than the longest program\nQuick recognition tips:\n- reduce sampling interval to 2–3 s for express programs\n- keep the window around 900–1 200 s if you mainly track 30 min cycles\n- run each program twice so the model learns reliable templates",
